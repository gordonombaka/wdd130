    <h2>Gordon Ombaka</h2>
    <p>Hello Everyone, I am from Nairobi, Kenya but currently living with 
       my family in a small town called Eldoret. I am married and have one  
       son. I currently serve as a Branch President in my branch. 
    </p>
    <p>My major is Applied Technology and I would like to focus in Web and Software Development
       for my future career. I am looking forward to learning a lot in this class about Web development. I 
       switched my career from teaching to Technology and I like learning new things in tech. I already
       have certificates in Computer Support and System Administration.
    </p>
    <p>I love to play and watch soccer. I also like spending my time with my family when I am free. </p>
